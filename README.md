In Cybersecurity, it could be a daunting task to apply and implement security concepts if there is an unavailability of practical and safe infrastructure to carry out these activities.

This is a project that keeps a simple approach while also containing key components necessary for network detection and monitoring practice. This environment is meant to provide a safe place to improve field-related skills while simulating a enterprise style architecture. In this repository, there will be quick and easy-to-understand walkthroughs of how to set up the components of this home lab.


*Disclaimer : The initial skeleton of this infrastructure was based on Day's Walkthrough on Cyberwox Academy. Links to his website will be provided below so make sure to check out his version of the setup as well as his walkthrough videos of some of the tools that were setup here.*
