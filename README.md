In Cybersecurity, it could be a daunting task to apply and implement security concepts if there is an unavailability of practical and safe infrastructure to carry out these activities. The quickest and simplest way to fix this issue is by creating a Home Lab to safely conduct or practice operations outside of a business environment. 

What is a Home Lab?

A home lab is a personal computing environment used for experimentation, learning, and testing new technologies. It typically consists of a collection of computer hardware and software that is used by enthusiasts, hobbyists, students, and professionals to develop and test new software applications, network configurations, virtualization setups, and other types of technology projects.

Home labs are often used by individuals who are interested in pursuing a career in the technology industry or who want to gain hands-on experience with various technologies outside of a formal educational setting. They can range from a simple setup with a single computer to complex networks with multiple servers and virtual machines.

Home labs can be useful for a variety of purposes, including testing new software, practicing system administration skills, learning about cybersecurity, experimenting with virtualization, and exploring different networking configurations. They can also be used to run personal projects, such as web servers, media servers, or game servers.

This is a project that keeps a simple approach while also containing key components necessary for network detection and monitoring practice. This environment is meant to provide a safe place to improve field-related skills while simulating a enterprise style architecture. In this repository, there will be quick and easy-to-understand walkthroughs of how to set up the components of this home lab.
