# Virtual-Home-Lab

In Cybersecurity, it could be a daunting task to apply and implement security concepts if there is an unavailability of practical and safe infrastructure to carry out these activities.

I approached this project with that in mind. This homelab walks through the process of configuring, optimizing, and securing an I.T infrastructure. Although this will be at a relatively small scale, you will be able to apply the knowledge gained in a real-world large-scale/enterprise infrastructure. his Homelab is an environment in your home that is used to practice and improve your skills in a specific field. This home lab has components and tools similar to large-scale infrastructures. Itâ€™s a safe environment to work with these components and learn how they work.

What does this Virtual Home Lab include?
- Using VMware Workstation Pro 17 as the "hypervisor"
- Configuring a pfSense firewall for Network Segmentation & Security
- Configuring Security Onion as an all-in-one IDS, Security Monitoring, and Log Management solution
- Configuring Kali Linux as an attack machine
- Configuring a Windows Server as a Domain Controller
- Configuring Windows desktops
- Configuring Splunk
- Ubuntu/CentOS/Metasploitable/DVWA/Vulnhub machines: All these are potential Linux machines that can be added to the network for exploitation, detection, or monitoring purposes
